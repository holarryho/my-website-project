# Welcome to the My Personal Website

This repository is designed to help you create your own personal website using HTML.

Technologies used: `HTML, CSS, git, Github Pages`

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

    A text editor (e.g. Sublime Text, Atom, VSCode)
    Git (for version control and deploying your website)
   
   
## Getting Started
1. Create a github account if you don't already have one.
2. Fork this repository to your GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of this page.
3. Clone your forked repository to your local machine using `git clone <URL of your forked repository>`
4. Open your text editor and navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository.

## Working on the main page
1. Create a new file called "template.html".
2. Take a look at the overview of the codebase and understand what each section does.
3. Understand what the necessary tags on each line do `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
4. Make changes to the text within each tag. You check your changes by opening "template.html" in a web browser.
5. Add and commit your changes using Git, then push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using `git push`.
6. Visit your GitHub repository and click the "Settings" button.
7. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section and select the branch where your website files are located.
8. Click "Save".
9. Your website should now be live at `https://<your GitHub username>.github.io/<name of your repository>`.

## Customizing Your Website

Feel free to modify your website as you see fit! You can add CSS stylesheets to make your website look more visually appealing, and even include JavaScript for interactivity.

## Deploying Changes

Any time you make changes to your website, simply add, commit, and push them to your repository. Your changes will automatically be updated on your live website.

Congratulations, you now have your very own personal website using HTML!
